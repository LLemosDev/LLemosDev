# 👋 Hi, I'm Lucas Amate

I'm a trainee developer and technical high school student at **IFSP (Federal Institute of São Paulo)**.  
Currently focused on building a solid foundation in **software development**, backend technologies, and problem-solving through real projects.

I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and improving my skills through hands-on development.
